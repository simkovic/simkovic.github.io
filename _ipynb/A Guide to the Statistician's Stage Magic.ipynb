      "We define an infinite series $a_n$ ($n \\gt 0$) along with its sum $S=\\sum_i a_i$. The sum of the first $n$ terms is $s_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ and we also define $s_0=0$. It follows that $a_n=s_n-s_{n-1}$ Then a person in audience is asked to choose a number. Say, the person chooses $42$. We now claim that $S=42$ regardless of the definition of $a_n$ . Audience gasps with disbelief. Now the magic starts. It trivially follows that \n",

      "Audience gasps with disbelief. An isolated nervous chuckle is heard from the back. Then the applause ensues. The croud cheers the magician. Either magic works or 42 is indeed the answer to everything! In any case it's an amazing result.\n",

      "In statistics there is a reliable procedure for generating similarly amazing tricks (they are often called paradoxes). It works like this.\n",

      "1. Take two different models of the data-generating process $M_1$ and $M_2$.\n",
      "2. Hide the fact that these are two different models from the audience. This can be most elegantly done by a choice of two models that produce identical results in most cases but wildly diverge for few cases . Leaving out the details of the two models also helps.\n",
      "3. Select and demonstrate a case where the divergence is most visible. Since the two models are \"identical\" this should not happen. Ergo magic works!\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of this procedure are \"demonstrations\" of nonconglomerability by Stone (1976; for brief description go [here](http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/flat-priors-in-flatland-stones-paradox/)). \n",

      "4. Select and demonstrate a case where one of the models fails miserably. Pair the procedures with the models such that the disfavoured procedure is applied along with the faulty model. Since the two models are \"identical\" it is not the model but the procedure that fails. Ergo, this Procedure should be abandoned!\n",

      "> A 10-meter-long research submersible with several people on board has lost contact with its surface support vessel. The submersible has a rescue hatch exactly halfway along its length, to which the support vessel will drop a rescue line.\n",
      "Because the rescuers only get one rescue attempt, it is crucial that when the line is dropped to the craft in the deep water that the line be as close as possible to this hatch. The researchers on the support vessel do not know where the submersible is, but they do know that it forms distinctive bubbles. These bubbles could form anywhere along the craft\u2019s length, independently, with equal probability, and float to the surface where they can be seen by the support vessel.\n",
      "The situation is shown in Figure 2A. The rescue hatch is the unknown location $\\theta$, and the bubbles can rise anywhere from $\\theta\u22125$ meters (the bow of the submersible) to $\\theta$+5 meters (the stern of the submersible). The rescuers want to use these bubbles to learn where the hatch is located\n",

In this situation, we can't say where the hatch is. The two bubbles could come from the bow or from the stern, but we don't know. When the two bubbles are far apart (right panel), one of them is at the bow and the other is at the stern. We then know with high precision that the hatch could be only located halfway between them. In this case instead CI incorrectly shows low precision."

      "Now here is how the show is performed at Caf\u00e9 Fischer. A good Bayesian ($P_B$) really shouldn't choose uniform distribution as a prior as we did above. It is highly unlikely that the lost submersible has been carried 1000 miles away from point of initial submersion point $\\theta_0$. Therefore a gaussian prior parametrized by mean $\\theta_0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_0$ is a much better choice. Then we choose the likelihood to be a conjugate distribution to the prior as is common in bayesian inference. This means that $p(x|\\theta)$ is gaussian ($M_1$), i.e. $x_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\theta,\\sigma)$. Next, we add a scaled inverse $\\chi$ prior for $\\sigma$ and marginalize over it. The posterior is a student's $t$ distribution. Discarding the negligible influence of the prior we obtain a 50% credible interval for $\\theta$ that is identical to the CI of the unconfident frequentist. "
